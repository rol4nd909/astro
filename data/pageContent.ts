    title: 'The evolution',
    copy: `The last couple of years in the digital experience & commerce industry, we've seen a major shift in technology. From purchasing suites and building, maintaining & hosting these yourself, to the introduction of SAAS platforms that you consume from the cloud, through an API. Today this means that typical and modern digital commerce platforms, consist of many different services that are integrated with eachother, together comprising your platform.`,

    title: 'MACH',
    copy: `Systems that adhere to the principles of Microservices, API-First, Cloud-Native and Headless, are identified as MACH services. Using them provides a lot of benefits and greatly accelerates creating new experiences for customers, and at the same time reducing the maintenance burden to keep a system like that running.`,

  {
    title: 'The problem',
    copy: `The problem with these systems, is that each individual system only provides part of the functionality you need. You end up with a 'composition' of multiple MACH services (duped 'composable commerce' by Gartner). In other words: it is a puzzle that you need to compose yourself in order to get the full picture. And there is no straightforward or standard
    way of technically integrating/glueing these pieces together. You need to rely on your system integrators 'creativity' to piece them together, often resulting in a hard to maintain (or understand), spaghetti of quite a number of micro services combined with cloud services and MACH services. Because building micro service architectures, is quite hard.`,

    title: 'Our solution',
    copy: `Through the experience of a number of high profile projects at scale, we've developed a standardized way of working and technical architecture, to build MACH platforms. This has led to a suite of tools, principles and boilerplate modules, that we call MACH composer. With it, we solve the 'integration problem' that you face when going down the MACH route.`,
