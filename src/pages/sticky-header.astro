        <h1>The Problem with Sticky Menus and Better Alternatives</h1>
        <p>
            Designers often use sticky menus (menus that stay visible at the edge of the screen) to
            make navigation easy on long pages. However, this approach can harm user experience more
            than it helps.
        </p>

        <h2>Issues with Sticky Menus:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Constantly Taking Up Space:</strong>
                <p>
                    Sticky menus cover the actual content, especially problematic on small screens.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Obscuring Content:</strong>
                <p>Elements like floating action buttons can hide important content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Zooming Challenges:</strong>
                <p>Zooming in can enlarge the menu, crowding the space for content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Accessibility Concerns:</strong>
                <p>They can be hard to access, especially if taller than the viewport.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Navigation Quirks:</strong>
                <p>Clicking on links to scroll within the page can cause confusion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Misleading Visibility:</strong>
                <p>
                    Sticky menus may seem easily accessible but can be distant for keyboard users.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Blocking Links and Focus:</strong>
                <p>They can cover links and cause focus issues during keyboard navigation.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Issues with Sticky Menus on Scroll:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Distracting Behavior:</strong>
                <p>The menu appearing as the user scrolls can be distracting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lack of Control:</strong>
                <p>Controlling when the menu appears or disappears can be challenging.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Health and Performance Concerns:</strong>
                <p>
                    Animations can cause discomfort and impact performance, especially on
                    low-powered devices.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Better Practices:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Keep Pages Short:</strong>
                <p>Address long pages to eliminate the need for sticky menus.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Allow Smooth Scrolling:</strong>
                <p>Scrolling is not a problem, even on mobile devices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Place Links Contextually:</strong>
                <p>Incorporate relevant links within the content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Back-to-Top Links Sparingly:</strong>
                <p>Employ back-to-top links as a last resort.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
